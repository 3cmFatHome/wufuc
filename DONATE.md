# Help support the development of wufuc

Thanks for showing an interest in donating to the development of wufuc!
While any support is very highly appreciated please keep in mind that donating will not guarantee you better support or other perks, just a warm fuzzy feeling knowing you really helped me out. :)

## Other donation options

Currently I'm only accepting Bitcoin, but I'm open to adding other ways of donating as long as they respect my privacy. 
If you know of a donation platform that fits this criteria and would like me to include it as an option, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/zeffy/wufuc/issues/new) and I will look into it.
